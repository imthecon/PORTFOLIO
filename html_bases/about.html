                <h2>MY GOAL</h2>
                <p>Hey. I'm Sarder, a 16 year old student managing his way around life. Right  to create programs and develop software that creates a positive and, eventually, global impact. Whether it be providing advice that can be directly applied into life or creating a robot that can perform surgery with over 99% accuracy, change for the better is the ultimate goal.</p>

                <h2>THE FUTURE</h2>
                <p>As a tech-geek high schooler in his senior years, I understand the importance of choosing a straight career path, but I don't think it could get any harder in the modern era of technology. With AI taking over a lot of future tech major choices (hmm, DEVIN), I'm thinking, "If we can't fix the problem, why don't we just join the problem?" Yeah, it sounds sort of stupid, but I'm desperately on my last attempts to put my knowledge and learning to good use in life, and I can't be the only one thinking this way. So, I don't know about you, but going into AI development sounds amazing right about now.</p>

                <p>If you want to check out my work, click on the PORTFOLIO tab to check out my recent work revolving around programming, neural networks and whatnot. Check out my GALLERY/SHOWCASE tab to take a look at some of the more school-based, learning projects I'm super proud of (especially regarding my age at the time).</p>
