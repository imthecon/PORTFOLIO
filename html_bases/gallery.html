                    <p>This is an infographic about anxiety, defining the topic, suggesting methods of treatments, and listing statistics.</p>
                    <p>I created this for a Physical Education project in grade ten. My teacher told us if we plagiarized an infographic created by someone else in the past, he wouldn't care. Although, I got hooked on learning about anxiety myself once I started, so I took the assignment relatively seriously, and this is how it turned out.</p>

                    width="1280" height="" loading="lazy">
                <figcaption>
                    <p>This is an infographic known as a "vision board", showing the interests, hobbies, and goals in the creator's future.</p>
                    <p>Similar to the previous infographic, I created this in grade 10 but for a Career Life Education class. This really helped me to dig deep and find out about the things that truly define me as a person.</p>
                    <p>Try to make out some of the things I've scrambled on there, maybe you'll learn more about me than what you'd find on my "ABOUT ME" page.</p>

                <figcaption>
                    <p>This is a two-paged poster about balancing out social media use in your life, relaying information about social media addiction, pros and cons, Canadian youth statistics, and methods to reducing use.</p>
                    <p>Just like the vision board prior, this was also created for my CLE 10 class. Created by my friend Zack and I, we presented this to the class. I'm proud of this one because our teacher liked it enough to print and place the two posters on the windows of our Student Services room (a place with somewhat high traffic throughout the day).</p>
